- This project dataset contains iris dataset iris.csv which contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
- These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.
- Required packages are for this project is pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, Logistic Regression, KNN, Deep Learning.
- Code completely implemented in python.
- Model trained and tested with supportive models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Deep Learning.
- Confusion matrix deployed with accuracy, precision, f1 score, recall, support for the above models
- Getting accuracy of the whole models and finally saving the models
